               <p> Certain <strong> disadvantages </strong> that may come about in the use of telepresence devices would be, but are not limited to, Price,connectivity and stability. </p>

        <h2> <u> High Speed  Internet  </u> </h2>
     	
     	    <p> Most telepresence devices require high speed internet connections to operate smoothly. The most typical reason for video conferencing failures is the lack of a robust network to support the calls. If your network can't support IP calling rates between devices at 384KBps to 768KBps how will it support telepresence calls requiring anywhere from 6MBps to 20MBps. If the bandwidth speeds on either end of the call is too weak or fluctuates too much, this can create delays and connection problems. </p>

             <h2> <u> Instability with Telepresence IP Devices </u> </h2>   
                
                 <p>Another negative connotation is the inherent instability when using trying to call infrequently used endpoints. As an example, your New York to London weekly call may usually work, but your annual Fiji to London call does not. Or similarly, your regular internal calls work, but your calls to a new customer or client site do not connect.

            <h2> <u> Price </u> </h2>   
            
             <p> The overall pricing of quality telepresence machines are a bit high. The cheapest consumer grade Virtual Reality headset usually goes for around 350 USD with the minimum required computer to run it costing at least 700USD. Telepresence robots cost around 2500 USD a month to lease, plus additional costs of up to one thousand dollars relating to the battery costs and maintenance. Unless youâ€™re a fortune 500 company I doubt that the general public as whole will be getting to test out this technology anytime soon. </p>
