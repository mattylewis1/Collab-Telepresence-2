        <h2> <u> Definition </u> </h2>
     	
     	    <p>Technology-based process of communicating using electronic assets and accompanying software which allow a person to feel as if they were at a place other than their true location. Components   such as mobile devices and virtual reality headsets which combine the use of video, audio and on-screen drawing capabilities using modern technology to enable multi-party conferencing in real-time, independent of location.</p>
     	    <p> My personal definition of collaborative telepresence is the use of any modern device that can utilize digital video and networking technology to enable remote individuals to interact as if they were in the same room. </p>
