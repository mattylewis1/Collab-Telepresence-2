         Hi, my name is Matthew Lewis, I am 19 years of age  and I attend the University Of Technology. Before Enrolling in university I attended Ardenne High School. I have a passion for Information Technology and hope to finish my bachelor's and practice computer engineering. I love building computers in my spare time, usually for family ,friends and clients. I also love reading about new technology and computer equipment. I recently got into Archery and shoot often at the Jamaica Rifle Association. Hopefully I can work hard enough and represent my country in the next  World Archery Championships.  In my spear time I play online computer games and help my family’s electrical company. I would like to think that I have an  Entrepreneurial Mind , I hope to own a successful computer store in the late future and also learn to trade the foreign exchange market. I don’t like to interact with selfish people, nor do I people who look down on others. I don’t like to socialize very much, I am currently working on bettering my social skills.
