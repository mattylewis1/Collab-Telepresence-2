        <h1> <u>  Telemedicine </u> </h1>    
     	
     	    <p>
              Telemedicine is a rapidly growing field and, with the aid of telepresence robots, is quickly gaining traction in hospitals and homes around the world. In rural hospital settings where a medical specialist is physically unavailable, a robot can be deployed to check in on a patient with a physician from elsewhere. In the home, a nurse can check in with a patient while they recover in a comfortable setting.

        <p> Orlando Health has taken a very different route with similar telepresence technology. They have designed a portable, self contained videoconferencing box that integrates with simple medical devices such as blood-pressure cuffs and pulse oximeters. This allows real-time interaction with patient and doctor  for basic medical checkups from long distances. Their goal is to reduce overall costs for patients and hospitals by minimizing inpatient admissions related to certain conditions. So far, the reaction from patients has been positive. They are happy to be at home while receiving the same standard of care they would be getting if they were admitted to the hospital.
        Telepresence isnâ€™t just being used to connect doctors and patients. It also allows doctors to communicate with other doctors for support, education, or cases where specialized treatment

        <p>  eEmergency programs has been providing support to clinicians in rural areas around the world. Using video conferencing technology, local doctors are able to communicate with board certified emergency medical physicians for help diagnosing and treating a variety of critical conditions. The program is saving lives, and saving money by reducing the need for patient transfers between hospitals.

        <h1> <u>  Telesurgery </u> </h1>
            <p> (Telesurgery) is the ability for a doctor to perform surgery on a patient even though they are not physically in the same location.</p>

             <p>Telepresence surgery and robotic telementoring are 2 revolutionary applications achieved by linking a robot to a telecommunication system. In telerobotic procedures, the surgeon operates from the surgeon's console, which is can thousands of miles away from the slave robotic arm mounted on the patient; the surgeon's commands are relayed to the slave manipulator via fiber-optic cables. Telepresence surgery allows surgeons to operate wherever their skills are needed without being in direct contact with the patient. This helps with procedures that require precision and accuracy.
